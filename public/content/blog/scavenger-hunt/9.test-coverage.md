# Test Coverage

Okay. Since I wasn't sure about code coverage with merging reports, unit testing, and end to end testing I figured out a way to make a decision.

Write all the tests. See what the coverage reports for unit vs end to end say. See how we feel about that. Make decisions from there.

Easy peasy lemon squeezy.
