## Introduction

Hi, my name is Jon(athan) and I have an overfondness for parentheticals. I'm a software engineer on a bit of an unpaid sabbatical and am looking to dabble in some new things to keep myself entertained and rust free.

So...

### Let's build a thing and learn a thing (or two, or "n")

AI is on the scene and I haven't tested it too thoroughly. Mostly it's been an "adaptive snippet maker" of sorts.

I know there is so much more though! And VS Code just a bunch of different Copilot features in their [October 2024 release](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_95).

So let's explore the new Copilot features and build a scavenger hunt app.

Every holiday season my friend makes a scavenger hunt for his family to solve and it always helps to have a specific use case in mind.

I'll track my learnings and mistakes in all their embarrassing glory so you can correct me, mock me, and (if we're lucky) learn an "n" amount of things with me.

Huzzah!
