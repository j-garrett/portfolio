## Using ChatGPT to use Vite for the first time

_QUICK NOTE: I've used block quotes to reflect which parts of the below text are copied from copilot's output._

The scope of this request to Copilot was larger than recommended, but I wanted to see how Copilot handled it for myself.

At first I requested ChatGPT tell me how to set up a new React project using Vite. Realizing that I forgot to mention TypeScript, I followed up with “Will this include TypeScript?”

> No, the command I provided earlier (`npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react`) does not include TypeScript by default. It sets up a plain JavaScript React project.
>
> However, you can easily set up a Vite project with React and TypeScript. Here's how you can do that:
>
> ### Steps to Create a Vite + React + TypeScript Project
>
> 1. **Create a New Project with TypeScript Template**
>
> Instead of using the `react` template, use the `react-ts` template to include TypeScript:
>
> ```bash
> npm create vite@latest my-react-ts-app --template react-ts
> ```
>
> This will create a Vite project with React and TypeScript pre-configured.
>
> 2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
>
> ```bash
> cd my-react-ts-app
> ```
>
> 3. **Install Dependencies**
>
> Now, install the necessary dependencies:
>
> ```bash
> npm install
> ```
>
> 4. **Start the Development Server**
>
> Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server:
>
> ```bash
> npm run dev
> ```
>
> Your app will be running at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
>
> ### Files & Structure for TypeScript
>
> - Your main entry file will now be `src/main.tsx` (note the `.tsx` extension for TypeScript JSX files).
> - Your root component will be `src/App.tsx`.
> - TypeScript configuration will be set up in `tsconfig.json`.
>
> ---
>
> By using the `react-ts` template, you'll automatically get TypeScript support, type definitions for React, and a proper `tsconfig.json` setup. You can now write React components using TypeScript throughout the project.
>
> ### Switching an Existing Project to TypeScript
>
> If you initially created a project with JavaScript and later decide to add TypeScript, you can follow these steps:
>
> 1. **Install TypeScript and Types for React**
>
> ```bash
> npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/react-dom
> ```
>
> 2. **Rename JavaScript Files to TypeScript**
>
> Rename your files from `.js` to `.tsx` (for files that contain JSX) or `.ts` (for regular TypeScript files).
>
> 3. **Create a `tsconfig.json` File**
>
> You can create a TypeScript configuration file by running:
>
> ```bash
> npx tsc --init
> ```
>
> Then you can configure it based on your project needs. Vite will automatically pick up your TypeScript configuration.
>
> 4. **Adjust JSX Syntax**
>
> Make sure that your JSX files are using TypeScript syntax (e.g., type annotations, interfaces, etc.).
>

> Let me know if you need more help with setting up TypeScript!

Bada boom.

Then I pasted the response into my markdown file and asked copilot to format that lovely block quote above. It's a bit more concise/direct that the [vite docs themselves](https://vite.dev/guide/), but steps 2-4 _are_ the output of `create`...

## Copilot, Set up routes for this project

I probably should have been more specific, but I did get directions to install `react-router-dom` and some code to paste into my `main.tsx` file to nest routes under the default Vite App.

## Copilot, create a file to contain a form using react hook form library

[_commit 1ace4525cdacba378b08a3f4967c842c9b308dfa_](https://github.com/j-garrett/scavenger-hunt-front/commit/1ace4525cdacba378b08a3f4967c842c9b308dfa)

> To create a form using the react-hook-form library, you can follow these steps:
>
> 1. Install react-hook-form:
>
>    `npm install react-hook-form`
>
> 2. Create a new file for the form component. Let's name it LocationForm.tsx.
>
> 3. Implement the form using react-hook-form:
>
> Here is an example implementation:

Well, it didn't tell me to include `-s` when I'm installing react-hook-form and the generated code didn't associate input labels with their inputs correctly.

> ```jsx
> <div>
>   <label>Location:</label>
>   <input {...register('location', { required: true })} />
>   {errors.location && <span>This field is required</span>}
> </div>
> ```

This error also let me know that my eslint config didn't have `jsxA11y` set up.

After setting up `jsxA11y` and prompting copilot to fix it inline we get:

> ```jsx
> <div>
>   <label htmlFor="clue">Clue:</label>
>   <input id="clue" {...register('clue', { required: true })} />
>   {errors.clue && <span>This field is required</span>}
> </div>
> ```

This works, but it's a little too verbose. My preferred solution would be:

```jsx
<label>
  Location:
  <input {...register('location', { required: true })} />
</label>
```

I'm coding less and code reviewing more. Every programmer's dream.
