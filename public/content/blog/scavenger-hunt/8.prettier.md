# Intermission: Cleaning up formatting

I've been a little distracted getting this repo going, but I've decided it's time to set up some of the autoformatting to make my code nice and `prettier`.

I added some of these tools in my current branch, but I don't want to add a bunch of noise to the work.

Since this is a personal project I was like "oh well, it's not _that_ big of a deal." But what if it wasn't a personal project? It would make for a pretty annoying PR review. Not the end of the world necessarily, but I'm already going a little overboard with the scope of the work (once again, this is a personal study/project) so let's do this one thing better.

I want to open a new branch and implement my formatting changes there. Then I can merge that to master and pull the changes into my `working` branch and that should keep the formatting changes from being flagged when my `working` branch is compared to `master`.

I could do all of this with my current dev setup, but I think I'll add a second copy of the repo locally so if something like this happens again or if I need to jump between "tickets" then I don't have to juggle git branches.

What do you think? Is this crazy? Unnecessary? Business as usual?
