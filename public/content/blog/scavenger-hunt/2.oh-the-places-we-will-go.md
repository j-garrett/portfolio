## Implementing Places API with Copilot

_QUICK NOTE: I've used block quotes to reflect which parts of the below text are copied from copilot's output._

Now we need to use the map to set up our target location. I think searching would be helpful for this to keep it in app. So let's go!

### Copilot, Make a new component to list the results of the places search

```jsx
import React from 'react'

type SearchResult = {
  name: string
  geometry: {
    location: {
      lat: () => number
      lng: () => number
    }
  }
}

type SearchResultsProps = {
  results: SearchResult[]
  onSelect: (location: { lat: number; lng: number }) => void
}

const SearchResults: React.FC<SearchResultsProps> = ({ results, onSelect }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Search Results</h2>
      <ul>
        {results.map((result, index) => (
          <li
            key={index}
            onClick={() =>
              onSelect({
                lat: result.geometry.location.lat(),
                lng: result.geometry.location.lng(),
              })
            }
          >
            {result.name}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Looks like we have a jsxa11y error

### Copilot, Redo that last result with jsxA11y

```jsx
{
  results.map((result, index) => (
    <li
      key={index}
      role="button"
      tabIndex={0}
      onClick={() =>
        onSelect({
          lat: result.geometry.location.lat(),
          lng: result.geometry.location.lng(),
        })
      }
      onKeyPress={(e) => {
        if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
          onSelect({
            lat: result.geometry.location.lat(),
            lng: result.geometry.location.lng(),
          })
        }
      }}
      style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}
    >
      {result.name}
    </li>
  ))
}
```

`<li>` elements are still non-interactive so we need to go inline to fix!

```jsx
{
  results.map((result, index) => (
    <button
      key={index}
      onClick={() =>
        onSelect({
          lat: result.geometry.location.lat(),
          lng: result.geometry.location.lng(),
        })
      }
      style={{
        cursor: 'pointer',
        display: 'block',
        width: '100%',
        textAlign: 'left',
        background: 'none',
        border: 'none',
        padding: '0',
        margin: '0',
      }}
    >
      {result.name}
    </button>
  ))
}
```

When looking at the above commit you'll notice that copilot inferred what I wanted to do when a result is clicked on: it centers the map on the target location. I was expecting that to be a separate request!

There were still some issues with types which resolved with inline copilot, but I had to be careful copilot didn't force custom types instead of using existing ones.

No, I don't need you to iterate over all results to filter out ones that don't have a specific key value. (Though that could cause errors down the line, I'm sure we'll have types yell at us when it matters.)

[_commit 9d9fa7c624628f1e228ba4a08eeef03c0c448b0f_](https://github.com/j-garrett/scavenger-hunt-front/commit/9d9fa7c624628f1e228ba4a08eeef03c0c448b0f)

Hmm, we center the map, but can we set a pin down?

### Copilot, place a pin on the map when a location is selected

The result does not work. I think it's supposed to have been placing the pin this whole time with the `<Marker>`, but that's never worked.

I'll manually dive into [google's advanced marker docs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/advanced-markers/add-marker).

And there we go. Check it out on this commit:

[_commit 87de3312cdbd3efea06c9a82a3ed523ef25bb4cd_](https://github.com/j-garrett/scavenger-hunt-front/commit/87de3312cdbd3efea06c9a82a3ed523ef25bb4cd)
Next we'll have to sort out what we're saving and if we have steps or single puzzles to solve.

Think this naive schema will work?

```TypeScript
interface IScavengerHunt {
    steps:{
        location: google.maps.places.PlaceResult
        clues: {type: 'img'|'string', value: string}[]
        solution: string
    }[]
}
```

Should we refactor some of the initial loading logic into a custom hook?
