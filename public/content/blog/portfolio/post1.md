### This Portfolio Site

I took a year hiatus from programming to focus on other hobbies, home improvement projects, and have a bit of a reset. If distance makes the heart grow fonder then a year away would make my heart grow plenty fond.

Now that year is up.

AI has grown by leaps and bounds. I haven't programmed anything for a bit and most of my past work experience is hidden behind proprietary walls.

So I'm going to program a few things that seem interesting, useful, and/or fun.

I'm using GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT and seeing what kind of assistance these tools can provide to build something interesting, useful, and/or fun.

Thanks for poking around!

### A work in progress

I know we all hate the "This site is under construction" banner that appears on sites that will never be constructed.

BUT, the purpose of my portfolio is to show my work and to that end the sooner it starts sharing then the sooner it's working.

So we look a little barebones. And I'm not a designer. And my personal projects were more explorations than inventions.

BUT, the purpose of my portfolio is to show my work. So let's start sharing and keep constructing. And maybe finish a few explorations.
